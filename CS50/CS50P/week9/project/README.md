#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/yCRqJyaxxfg

#### Description:
This is a classic snake game implemented with Python and the Pygame library. The game starts with a black screen that contains the title of the game, a instruction saying "Press "Space" to Start" and a written tutorial saying that you should use the arrow keys to move, if you hit the border of the window the snake will wrap around to the other side. Your goal is to control the snake to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen, which causes the snake to grow in length, and avoid hitting your own body. Once the you inevitably a game over screen will pop ou that contains your score, which is the amount of food you've eaten, and the option to either quit the game or restart it, if you choose the restart option the title screen will not appear againa.

#### How to Play:
- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake can move up, down, left, or right.
- The snake can not move opposite the direction it currently is moving. 
(i.e, If you are going right pressing the left arrow key wont do anything) 
- Try to eat the food that appears on the screen to score points and grow the snake.
- Avoid running into the snake's own body, as this will result in a game over.
- The game has wrap-around edges, meaning the snake can move through one edge of the screen and appear on the opposite edge.

#### Features:
- **Start Screen**: A start screen with the game title and instructions.
- **Smooth Movement**: The snake moves smoothly at a constant speed.
- **Food and Growth**: Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the score increases.
- **Game Over Screen**: A game over screen displays the score and provides options to restart or quit the game.
